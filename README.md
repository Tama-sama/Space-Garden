# Space's Garden
 Space's garden is a shooting game created in C++ using SFML library. 
This project was made by an Artist, [Laurine Bescond-Moyon](https://www.artstation.com/ophiushus) and I.
Space's garden was made in 4 weeks by two students in their first year.

### What I've learned :
- Make custom controls (Keyboard and Gamepad).
- Local Multiplayer.
- Check collisions (Don't do squares with rotation in SFML, it expands the box).
